LC-Micro-Slider
==============

Why another jQuery slider plugin? 
Well: 
* is easy to use
* modern (CSS based)
* as responsive as you need
* super-easy to customize and extend
* Touch-ready using TouchSwipe or AlloyFinger
* has got public methods and actions
* can slide anything
* is just 13KB (JS + CSS)

..and yes, has got an **image lazyloader**!

==============
 
Including [TouchSwipe](https://github.com/mattbryson/TouchSwipe-Jquery-Plugin) or [AlloyFinger](https://github.com/AlloyTeam/AlloyFinger/), it also supports touch interactions.

Only requirement is jQuery v1.5 (but please, do not expect IE8 support!)
